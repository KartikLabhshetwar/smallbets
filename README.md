# Small Bets

[Small Bets](https://smallbets.com) is an online community to support new and aspiring entrepreneurs. This repository contains the source code for the Small Bets web application, which is based on a modified version of [Campfire](https://github.com/basecamp/once-campfire/), a Ruby on Rails chat application built by [37signals](https://once.com/campfire).

We modified Campfire extensively to serve the needs of the Small Bets community. We have a list of [some of the major modifications](campfire-mods.md), along with references to the source code. If you like any of our changes, feel free to incorporate them into your own Campfire instance.
